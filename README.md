# mars-exploration
This is a small programm for NASA (not realy ;) ) to help them explore Mars with rovers.

To run the project execute in root directory:

`ruby lib/nasa.rb`

It will read the defaults from `tests/expedition_1`

You can set your own input file as a parameter:

`ruby lib/nasa.rb path/to/your/file`

Run tests with RSpec from root folder:

`rspec spec`

Feel free to contact me at pavel@valadzko.com if you have any questions.
